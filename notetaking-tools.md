This isn't markdown, just something that looks kind of like it.

# Tagspaces
Version required: 2.9.0
Can't test it because I can't connect a location with NVDA or JAWS

# Notebooks
Version: 1.4.2
Completely fucked

# QOwnNotes 
Version: 18.09.1
QT, but seems sort of accessible. The edit box reads, the notes tree view reads if you can get to it.
It doesn't seem to work very well, maybe focus issues?

# OneNote 2016
